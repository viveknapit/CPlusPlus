                                Tree Data Structure

A tree data Structure is a hierarchical Structure taht is used to represent and organze data in a way that is easy to navigate and search . It is a collection of nodes that are connected by edges and has a hierarchical relationship b/w the nodes.

        Terminologies in Tree data Structure
> Parent Node: the node which is a predecessor of a node is called the parent node of 
 that node. 

> Child Node: the node which is the immediate succesor of a node is called as child node of that node.

> Root Node: the topmost node of a tree or a node which does not have any parent is called as root node.

> Leaf Node or External Node: the nodes which do not have any child nodes are called leaf nodes.

> Ancestor of a node: Any predecessor nodes on the path of the root to that node are called Ancestor of thata node.

> Descendant: any succesor node on the path from the leaf node to that node 

> Sibling: children of the same parent node are called as siblings.

> Level of a node: the count of edges on the path from the root node to that node.

> Internal node: a node with atleast one child is called internal node.

> Neighbour of a node: Parent or child nodes of that node are called Neighbours of that node.

> Subtree: any node of the tree along with its Descendant.
